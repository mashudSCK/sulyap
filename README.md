## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Landing**: User clicks "Start Chatting"
2. **Waiting**: Server adds user to waiting queue
3. **Pairing**: When another user joins, server pairs them
4. **Chatting**: Users exchange messages in real-time
5. **Ending**: Either user can end chat; both are disconnected

### Technical Architecture

#### Backend (server.js)
- Express server serves frontend static files and admin API
- Socket.IO manages WebSocket connections for chat and admin dashboard
- Waiting queue stores unpaired users
- Active pairs map tracks current conversations
- Admin tracking excludes admin connections from user counts
- Real-time event broadcasting for charts and metrics
- Feedback system with JSON file storage
- Hourly message tracking for analytics
- Session duration calculation
- All chat data exists only in memory (no database)

#### Frontend (app.js)
- Socket.IO client connects to server
- Event-driven architecture for UI updates
- Screen management system (landing, waiting, chat, disconnected)
- Real-time message rendering with reply functionality
- Browser notification system (requires permission)
- Referral code generation and tracking
- Online user counter display
- Fixed header with custom username support

#### Admin Dashboard (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)
- Real-time WebSocket connection with auto-reconnection
- Recharts for live animated data visualization
- React Router for page navigation
- JWT-based authentication
- Dark mode with localStorage persistence
- Responsive mobile-first design
- API proxy to backend (port 3000)
- TailwindCSS with custom Sulyap color palette

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Random Pairing Algorithm
- First user joins → added to waiting queue
- Second user joins → paired with first user
- Both removed from queue and added to active pairs
- Private channel established for their conversation

### Privacy & Security
- No user data collection
- No message logging or storage
- No cookies or tracking
- Messages exist only in transit
- Conversation deleted on disconnect

### Real-Time Communication
- WebSocket protocol via Socket.IO
- Bidirectional event-based communication
- Auto-reconnection on network issues
- Disconnect detection and handling

## Configuration

### Port Configuration

Default port is `3000`. To change:

```javascript
// In backend/server.js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

### CORS Settings

To allow connections from specific origins:

```javascript
// In backend/server.js
const io = socketIO(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: "http://yourdomain.com",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  }
});
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Testing

### Local Testing with Multiple Users

1. Start the server
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in two browser windows/tabs
3. Click "Start Chatting" in both windows
4. Test messaging, disconnection, and reconnection

### Network Testing

Test on local network:
1. Find your local IP (e.g., `ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux)
2. Access from another device: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`

## Security Considerations

- Rate limiting recommended for production
- Consider adding profanity filter
- Implement report/block functionality for abuse
- Add CAPTCHA to prevent bot spam
- Use HTTPS in production (Render provides free SSL)

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Ensure server is running (`npm start` in backend directory)
- Check firewall settings
- Verify port is not in use

### "Waiting forever for partner"
- Open another browser window to test
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify Socket.IO connection in browser console

### Messages not sending
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Socket.IO connection status
- Ensure both users are properly paired

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Video/audio chat support
- [ ] Interest-based matching
- [ ] Language preferences
- [ ] Message reactions/emojis
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Rate limiting and spam protection
- [ ] User activity timeline in admin dashboard
- [ ] Export analytics reports (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Email notifications for admins
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Multi-language support (Tagalog, English)
